    <h3>Six of Crows</h3>
    <p>Six of Crows is a high speed fantasy duology that follows the adventures of Kaz Brekker and his crew of criminals on their mission to liberate a Shu scientist who is the creator of a drug very dangerous to Grisha called jurda parem. They must make a perilous journey to the Ice Court, a high security prison in the country of Fjerda. Each character has an intricate reason and motivation for making the journey, even at risk of their lives. </p>

    <h3>Kaz Brekker</h3>
    <p>Kaz Brekker is the seventeen year old lieutenant of the crew called the Dregs, otherwise nicknamed the Crows. He is motivated by revenge and honestly sometimes he just wants money. However, he also is enamored with Inej, another member of the crew. He is very closed off and gaurded but it is obvious that he wants to bring down another powerful crew leader, Pekka Rollins. </p>
    <h3>Inej Ghafa</h3>
    <p>Inej Ghafa is a sixteen year old Suli girl who is very religious and loves to annoy Kaz with her proverbs. She carries many knives on her person (fourteen at the least) and is a spider that gathers information to report to Kaz, hence her nickname the Wraith. She is haunted by her time in a pleasure house known as the Menagerie and so is driven by her motivation to use her earnings from the Ice Court job to buy a ship and hunt slavers.</p>
    <h3>Nina Zenik</h3>
    <p>Nina Zenik is an eighteen year old Grisha from the country of Ravka. She was taken by Fjerdan witch hunters while on a mission for her country's army, among them a boy named Matthias Helvar. They were able to escape together during a shipwreck to the country of Kerch. Through a string of many unfortunate events Matthias ends up in jail on Nina's accusation of his being a slaver (there's just no time to explain it all). Kaz gets her on the job by promising to free Matthias from prison and get him a pardon from Ravka.</p>
    <h3>Matthias Helvar</h3>
    <p>After his time in the prison Hellgate, nineteen year old Matthias Helvar is understandably upset. Unfortunately this means that he tries to strangle Nina immediately upon his rescue from prison. Fortunately, however, Kaz is always around to handle him. Matthias joins the Ice Court job in the hopes of thwarting these criminals' desires to infiltrate his country's proudest stronghold. He finds himself engaging in tomfoolery with Jesper and Kaz and wonders if the sea air is rotting his brain. But, in the end, he falls hopelessy in love with Nina Zenik (understandably) and aids the mission.</p>
    <h3>Jesper Fahey</h3>
    <p>Jesper Fahey is a seventeen year old Zemeni sharpshooter and close (though one or both of them would disagree for very different reasons) friend of Kaz. He came to Kerch from Novyi Zem to study at the Ketterdam university but instead of falling into his school work he falls in love with the dice and debauchery of the Barrel. He is eager to join the heist because he needs the money to pay off his gambling debts and also because he loves to stick close to his good friends Inej and danger.</p>
    <h3>Wylan Van Eck</h3>
    <p>Wylan Van Eck is a sixteen year old demolitions expert, flautist, chemist, and the son of the mercher hiring Kaz and his crew, Jan Van Eck. Wyaln doesn't know that Kaz is aware of his family situation but, alas, Kaz knows everything. Wylan joins the heist because he has fled from his father and needs money to make a new life for himself. Also, Kaz is using him for leverage ofer Van Eck, but honestly how important is that, really? He often wonders why he's there with the Crows at all, but any time he has doubts Jesper is there to gently reassure him (and Kaz, less gently).</p>
